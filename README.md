[Moonlight](http://moonlight-stream.com) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield, but built for iOS. Moonlight iOS allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful desktop computer to your iOS Device.

There are also versions for [Android](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android) and [PC](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-pc).

#### The code in this repository compiles and runs in Apple TV, using the Moonlight tvOS target. The original modifications for tvOS are taken from [https://github.com/apocolipse/moonlight-ios](https://github.com/apocolipse/moonlight-ios) and rebased on top of [https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios).
